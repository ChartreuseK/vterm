# vterm

A vintage style terminal emulator using a fixed bitmap font with scanlines using SDL2. 

The terminal supports many ansi escape codes and works well with most linux programs, such as vim, htop, elinks, and nano. 
It currently operates at a fixed size of 80x25 with no scaling. Though it could be modified to allow for integer or fractional resizing using SDL's window creation options in disp.c

This terminal is more of a toy/hobby project so I do not recommend using this as your daily driver terminal, but more as something to learn from or play around with, or reuse code from in other projects.
